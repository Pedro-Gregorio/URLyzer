# URLyzer

A project created to analyze an URL and extract the several query parameters, with a built-in functionality to copy the query value to the clipboard.

## Goal

The goal of this app is to allow users to quickly identify the query parameters present in a given url and to copy their value to the clipboard if desired.

## Tech Stack Used

The project was built using React, with Redux, and Tailwind. I had previously built this same project using EJS, but wanted to challenge myself and take the whole thing to another level, with the introduction of a theme swap, as well as more details regarding the URL being analyzed.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, you need to have Node installed.

On the project root, make sure to run `npm install`, to install the required dependencies. To start the project then run `npm run dev`.

## To anyone reading...

Thank you for reading! I've built this project to practice some React concepts I'm learning. I am, by no means, a Pro in this, so feel free to reach out to give some feedback and suggest improvements/features! Can't wait to create more stuff ðŸ‘€
